# Releasing Altus +

The in-app updater (`src/updater.ts`, electron-updater) reads the latest
**published, non-prerelease** GitHub release of `lukethehawk/altus-plus` and needs
three files attached to it:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Altus-Plus-Setup-<version>.exe` | the NSIS installer |
| `latest.yml` | version, file name and SHA512 the app verifies before installing |
| `Altus-Plus-Setup-<version>.exe.blockmap` | lets the next update download only what changed |

A release without `latest.yml` is ignored by the updater (users get an error
on a manual check and nothing on startup).

## Steps

1. Bump `version` in `package.json` (e.g. `5.8.1-plus.3` → `5.8.1-plus.4`) in
   the PR, merge it into `master`.
2. Wait for the **Altus + Windows installer** run on `master` and download its
   `Altus-Plus-Windows` artifact: it contains the three files above, built
   with `yarn install --immutable`.
3. Check that `latest.yml` names the same version and that its `sha512`
   matches the installer.
4. Create the release on the merge commit, tag `v<version>`, attach the three
   files, publish it as **Latest** (not as a pre-release).

Running installs download the update in the background, offer "Restart now /
Later", and otherwise install it silently the next time the app quits.

## Electron updates

Electron ships Chromium security fixes in its patch releases, usually
without an npm advisory. The **Electron updates** workflow
(`.github/workflows/electron-release.yml`) runs every day and fails, so
GitHub emails the owner, when:

- a newer release of the pinned major line is out. The run summary lists
  each one with its date, Chromium version and release notes;
- the pinned major line is no longer supported. Electron supports the
  latest three major versions.

It warns without failing when the pinned line becomes the oldest supported
one, which leaves time to plan the move to a new major.

When it fails:

1. In one PR, set `electron` in `package.json` to the newest exact version
   from the run summary, run `yarn install`, and bump `version` to the next
   `-plus.N`.
2. Read the release notes in between. The PR's smoke test (see
   `TESTING-ELECTRON44.md`) covers startup, tabs, the installer and the
   fuses. Run the manual regression checks there that the notes touch, then
   merge.
3. Release as described above.

Moving to a new major is a separate, planned change.

## Testing the updater locally

`ALTUS_TEST_UPDATE_FEED` (read at build time by `vite.main.config.ts`) points a
build at a generic feed instead of GitHub; release builds never set it.

1. Build the "new" version with `yarn make -p win32` and serve `out/make`
   (installer, `latest.yml`, `.blockmap`) over HTTP, e.g. on port 8765.
2. Build an older version with
   `ALTUS_TEST_UPDATE_FEED=http://127.0.0.1:8765/ yarn package -p win32`.
3. Run it with `--user-data-dir` on a throwaway profile and use
   Help → Check for Updates. Do not choose "Restart now" on a machine where
   Altus + is installed for real: the installer would replace it.
