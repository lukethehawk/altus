Altus + is a maintained fork of [**Altus**](https://github.com/amanharwara/altus) by [Aman Harwara](https://github.com/amanharwara), an Electron wrapper around WhatsApp Web with tabs for multiple accounts.

The original project is no longer updated. Altus + keeps it running on a current Electron and adds what daily use with several accounts needs. It puts **security first, then stability, then resource use**.

## Highlights

| | |
|---|---|
| 👥 **Multiple accounts** | One tab per WhatsApp account, each in its own isolated session. |
| 🔔 **Clear notifications** | Notification titles show the account (`Work · Mario Rossi`). A click opens the right tab and chat. |
| 🔕 **Per-account mute** | Right-click a tab to mute it for 1 hour, 8 hours or until you turn it back on. Other accounts keep notifying. |
| 🔊 **Background audio** | Voice messages keep playing when you switch tab; inactive tabs are never suspended or muted. |
| 📎 **Download notice** | "Attachment saved · Show in folder" after each download. |
| 🩹 **Crash recovery** | A crashed or frozen account reloads on its own without touching the others. |
| ⬆️ **In-app updates** | New releases download in the background, are verified (SHA512) and install with one click. A notice stays on screen while they install. |
| 🌐 **English / Italiano** | Settings → Language, applied at once. |
| 🛡️ **Hardened** | Up-to-date Electron (44), tamper-checked app package, locked-down executable and window. [Details](#security). |

## Download

1. Download **`Altus-Plus-Setup-<version>.exe`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/lukethehawk/altus-plus/releases/latest).
2. Run it and follow the setup.

> [!NOTE]
> The installer is not code-signed, so Windows SmartScreen may show "Windows protected your PC". Click **More info → Run anyway**. Each release lists the installer's SHA256 if you want to check it.

From then on Altus + updates itself. It checks at startup (Settings → *Check for updates at startup*) or from **Help → Check for Updates**, then asks **Restart now / Later**.

### Coming from the original Altus

If the original Altus is on the PC, a first install of Altus + asks how to proceed:

- **Install next to Altus**: the two apps stay separate, each with its own accounts and settings. Nothing of the original Altus is read or changed.
- **Replace Altus**:
  1. Altus is closed.
  2. Its WhatsApp accounts, tabs, settings and themes are copied into Altus +, so there is no need to scan the QR codes again.
  3. Altus is uninstalled and its autostart entry removed.
  4. Its data folder is kept as a backup in `%APPDATA%\Altus (backup YYYY-MM-DD)`; delete it yourself once everything works.

  If the copy fails, Altus is left as it was.

Updates and reinstalls never ask again. For unattended installs, `Altus-Plus-Setup-<version>.exe /S --replace-altus` performs the replacement, and `/S` alone installs next to Altus.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| New tab | `Ctrl+T` |
| Edit current tab | `Ctrl+E` |
| Close current tab | `Ctrl+W` |
| Reopen closed tab | `Ctrl+Shift+T` |
| Next / previous tab | `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` |
| First / last tab | `Ctrl+1` / `Ctrl+9` |
| Settings | `Ctrl+,` |
| Theme manager | `Alt+T` |
| Check for updates | `Ctrl+Shift+U` |
| Quit | `Ctrl+Q` |

## Privacy

Altus + loads WhatsApp Web and nothing else in its tabs. Its only other connection is to GitHub, to check for updates, and you can switch that off. There is no telemetry.

## Security

| Area | What Altus + does |
|---|---|
| **Accounts** | Each account runs in its own sandboxed, isolated session; one account cannot see another's data. |
| **Web content** | Tabs can only stay on WhatsApp Web. Other links open in your browser, pop-ups are blocked, and the app's internal messages are checked against the window or tab that sent them. |
| **App window** | A Content-Security-Policy lets the window run only Altus +'s own code. |
| **Executable** | Electron fuses turn off `RunAsNode`, `NODE_OPTIONS` and `--inspect`, so other programs cannot use the Altus + executable to run their own code. |
| **Integrity** | At startup the app checks its own package (`app.asar`) and refuses to start if it has been modified. |
| **Updates** | Downloaded only from this repository's releases and installed only if the SHA512 matches. |
| **Dependencies** | A weekly audit fails on new high or critical advisories in the app's dependencies and on any Electron advisory; Dependabot proposes security fixes. A daily check flags each new Electron release, which carries Chromium's security fixes, and the end of support of the Electron version in use. Known advisories and why they do not affect the app are listed in [`docs/DEPENDENCY-AUDIT-ELECTRON44.md`](docs/DEPENDENCY-AUDIT-ELECTRON44.md). |

Not done yet: the installer is not code-signed, and session cookies are stored the way Chromium stores them by default (not encrypted). Found a security problem? Please report it through a [private security advisory](https://github.com/lukethehawk/altus-plus/security/advisories/new) rather than a public issue.

## Build from source

Requires Node.js 22 or later and Corepack (Yarn 4).

corepack enable
yarn install --immutable
yarn start        # run in development
yarn lint         # type check + ESLint
yarn test         # unit tests
