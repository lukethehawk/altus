# Altus + (Electron 44 fork)

Altus + installs and runs next to official Altus: it has its own Windows
installer identity, app title, autostart name and Electron user-data path, and
never reads or changes official Altus's sessions.

| Setting | Official Altus | Altus + |
|---|---|---|
| Product name | Altus | Altus + |
| App ID | harwara.aman.altus | com.lukethehawk.altusplus |
| Windows data directory | Usually `%APPDATA%\\Altus` | `%APPDATA%\\Altus Electron 44 Test` |
| whatsapp:// registration | Optional | **Disabled** |
| Electron | 35.1.5 | 44.10.0 |

The data directory keeps the name of the earlier "Altus Electron 44 Test"
builds, so accounts paired there stay logged in. A first install pairs new
WhatsApp Web sessions; nothing is copied from official Altus.

### Moving from "Altus Electron 44 Test" to Altus +

1. Quit the test build from the tray (both apps share the profile, so only
   one can run).
2. Install Altus +: the accounts are already there.
3. Uninstall "Altus Electron 44 Test" from Windows settings. Its uninstaller
   does not delete `%APPDATA%\\Altus Electron 44 Test`, and Altus + removes the
   test build's autostart entry on its first start.

## Build and installation on Windows

In GitHub Actions, open a successful **Altus + Windows installer** run on
`master` and download the `Altus-Plus-Windows` artifact. Extract the ZIP and
launch the contained installer.

Or locally, using Node.js 22 and Corepack:

```powershell
corepack enable
yarn install --immutable
yarn lint
yarn make -p win32
```

Verify the resulting installer/window says **Altus +** before
signing in. Windows SmartScreen may warn about unsigned binaries.

## Smoke tests

1. Launch official Altus and Altus + side by side; confirm their accounts and settings differ.
2. Pair a test WhatsApp account and verify it stays connected after closing/reopening.
3. Test download/upload, external links, clipboard copy/paste, media permissions,
   two accounts, notifications and close-to-tray.
4. Monitor idle CPU and RAM in Windows Task Manager with equal account counts.
5. Quit the test build and verify original Altus still starts with existing sessions.

## Regression checks for the hardening branches

Installing a newer Altus + build over an existing one keeps the same
`%APPDATA%\\Altus Electron 44 Test` profile, so paired accounts should stay
logged in.

1. **Voice message from a background tab:** with three accounts A, B, C,
   play a voice message in B, switch to A and then C: the audio keeps playing.
   Turning sound off for B silences only B.
2. **Notifications** arrive from all three accounts while another tab, or the
   tray, is in front.
3. **Links:** a link in a chat opens in the default browser; the tab stays on
   WhatsApp Web. Downloads, uploads, image previews and copy/paste still work.
4. **Reopen closed tab:** close a tab, use "Restore closed tab": the account
   is still logged in.
5. **Crash recovery:** in Task Manager end one of the "Altus +"
   renderer processes. The affected tab (or the whole window, if that
   renderer was the app UI) reloads within a few seconds on its own and stays
   logged in; other accounts are not reloaded.
6. Autostart on/off in settings still applies after a restart.
7. **Download notice:** download an attachment; "Attachment saved / Show in
   folder" appears for a few seconds and the button opens Explorer with the
   file selected. With "Show save dialog" on (the default) it appears after
   the file is saved.
8. **Multi-account notifications:** a message to a background account shows
   "<tab name> · <sender>" as title. Clicking it brings Altus forward (also
   from the tray), switches to that account and WhatsApp opens the chat.
9. **Per-account mute:** right-click a tab, "Mute notifications for 1 hour":
   that account shows a crossed bell and no desktop notifications, while
   unread counts still update and the other accounts still notify.
   "Unmute notifications" restores them; timed mutes expire on their own.
10. **In-app update:** with a newer release published (see
    `docs/RELEASING.md`), Help → Check for Updates says it is downloading,
    then offers "Restart now / Later". "Restart now" installs silently and
    reopens the new version with accounts and settings intact; "Later"
    installs it when the app is quit from the tray or menu. While it
    installs, a small "Updating Altus +" notice (in the app's language)
    stays on screen and closes when the install is done.
11. **Language:** a new profile starts in English. Settings → Language →
    Italiano switches menus, settings, tab dialogs, tray menu, the tab
    right-click menu and the exit prompt at once, with no English left;
    the choice survives a restart and English switches everything back.
12. **Original Altus on the PC (first install only):** the installer shows
    "Altus is already installed".
    - *Install next to Altus* leaves the original program, data and
      autostart untouched.
    - *Replace Altus* closes it and copies its profile into Altus +, which
      opens with the same tabs and settings and the accounts still logged in.
      It then renames `%APPDATA%\Altus` to `Altus (backup <date>)`,
      uninstalls the original and removes its `Altus` autostart entry.
    - Reinstalling or updating Altus + never shows the page.

### Automated smoke test

Every PR (`windows-package` check) and every `master` build run
`.github/scripts/smoke-test.mjs` on the packaged app. A `master` build that
fails it uploads no installer.

1. The fuses in the executable match `forge.config.ts`.
2. A modified `app.asar` is refused at startup.
3. On a fresh profile, the window loads in English with one tab. That tab
   reaches WhatsApp Web, and its preload reports the tab's ID. The app
   window has a Content-Security-Policy and logs no console errors,
   exceptions or CSP violations.
4. `Setup.exe /S --replace-altus` with fake original Altus data (Italian,
   tabs "Personale" and "Lavoro"):
   - the profile is copied and the backup folder is created;
   - the installed app opens those tabs, in Italian, on the original
     partitions.
5. A reinstall changes neither the Altus + profile nor the original data.
6. Uninstalling removes the program and keeps the profile.

Failures attach logs and screenshots (`smoke-artifacts`) to the run. Checks
4-6 install and uninstall for real, so they only run on GitHub's throwaway
runners. Locally, `yarn package -p win32` then `yarn smoke` runs checks 1-3
on a temporary profile.

### Packaged smoke run without touching your profile

`--user-data-dir` overrides the profile folder and skips autostart changes,
so a build can be checked on a throwaway profile. Keep the path short:
Chromium's CacheStorage fails beyond Windows' 260-character path limit.

```powershell
& ".\out\Altus +-win32-x64\Altus +.exe" --user-data-dir="$env:TEMP\altus-smoke"
```

Only use this branch for evaluation. Do not merge it into `master` until
Windows behavior and session isolation have been verified.
